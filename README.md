# OmnidirectionRobot
This project intends to develop an omnidirectional robot car with stereo vision camera and solid state lidar sensor. It will further explore SLAM, RL based control, and autonomous driving stack. The first goal is to add ROS2 based control to the raspberry pi controlled robot car.
